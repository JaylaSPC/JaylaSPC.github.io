        <h3>Thing I like to do (Not in any particular order):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming
                <p>
                    I've always loved programming since I was in elementary school.
                    It started out with Scratch, making animations and games with my friend.
                    Eventually I moved on to making Discord bots and making other small programs.
                    I tried to make a few games in Godot and Unity as well.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Making music
                <p>
                    This is a newer endeavor but I have made a few songs that I enjoy, but I
                    cannot share them because it would doxx me :3
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Drawing
                <p>
                    I've always loved drawing since I was in elementary and I use my skills
                    to create art for my music videos.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
